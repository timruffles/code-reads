# Javascript code-reads

These are code-reads carried out by Tim Ruffles. A code-read is a concept I came across via [created by Jeremy Ashkenas](http://ashkenas.com/code-reads/) of Backbone fame - a complete read through of a project with feedback given on correctness, style and readability. The code-reads  here were requested by the projects' authors.

The code-reads here are not indictments of the code - these projects are fantastic, often doing things I have little expertise in ([Ratio](https://github.com/timruffles/code-reads/tree/master/ratio) handles floating-point edge-cases I have to plead ignorance of). What I'm looking at is clean code - DRY, redundancy-free, idiomatic, well-named code: Javascript that's a pleasure to read.

If you'd like a code read please get in touch. By preference I'd like to look at application code. I'm working on a code-quality tool for Javascript - [sidekickjs](https://www.sidekickjs.com) - so looking at app code improves the product for its target audience: teams writing Javascript applications.
